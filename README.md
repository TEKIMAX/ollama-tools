## üîç Usage

### Remove Ollama Models Script

This script helps you manage your installed Ollama models by providing an easy way to remove them.

```bash
./remove_ollama_models.sh
```

#### Options:

- Enter a **number** to select and remove a specific model
- Enter **'a'** to remove all installed models at once
- Enter **'q'** to quit without removing any models

#### Example Walkthrough:

1. When you run the script, it will list all your installed models:
   ```
   Fetching available Ollama models...
   Available models:
   1. mistral-small3.1:latest
   2. qwen3:latest
   3. llama3.1:8b
   4. granite3.1-dense:8b
   5. llama2:latest
   6. llama3.1:latest
   7. deepseek-r1:8b
   8. hf.co/bartowski/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-GGUF:Q8_0
   ```

2. You'll then be prompted to make a selection:
   ```
   Enter the number of the model to remove, 'a' to remove all models, or 'q' to quit:
   ```

3. After entering your choice, you'll be asked to confirm:
   ```
   You selected: llama3.1:8b
   Are you sure you want to remove this model? (y/n)
   ```

4. The script will then remove the selected model or exit based on your confirmation.
